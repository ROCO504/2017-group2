design process:
problems:
	Initial kinematics 	|||
	how to store force 	-
	speed of:		
		camera		|
		processing	-
		motors		||
	torque of motors	-




research:
	kinematic solutoin(s):
		Verbal discussion of how we derived kinematic solution 2
	motors?:
		Stepper performance
		Gearboxes


requirements:
	active gripper:
		Speed of closing
		Compliance
	passive gripper:
		FEA/strength
	throwing mechanism:
		Stored force?
			Clamps
	Frame:
		Materials, structure, strength
	Computer vision:
		Filtering, speed, tracking, distance, robustness (can we get a number for that?)
	gripper motion?
	Force needed to store
	catching?
		All of the above?


solutions:
	Visual Servoing		-
	Motors:
		Micro(gearbox)	|
		Stepper		|
	clamps			|||
	ps3 cam			||
	processor		-
	servos			-
	Passive gripper		-
	Active gripper		-

Prototype			||

problems:
	Speed, torque (mainly torque), open loop (not an issue if enough torque)
test/redev:
	servos			|



Implementation
	Frame
	kinematics
	camera/opencv
	gripper(s)
	clamps




Experiments (Method, Results, and Discussion for each):
	Computer vision (traking, distance, reliability, gripper closing)
	Throwing (average distance, correction of lower cord lengths)
	movement speed of gripper
	gripping speed of gripper
	Clamps
	Tensioning
