intro
design process:
problems:
	speed of:
		camera
		processing
		motors
	torque of motors
	how to store force
	Initial kinematics


research:
	kinematic solutoin(s):
		Verbal discussion of how we derived kinematic solution 2
	motors?:
		Stepper performance
		Gearboxes


requirements:
	active gripper:
		Speed of closing
		Compliance
	passive gripper:
		FEA/strength
	throwing mechanism:
		Stored force?
			Clamps
	Frame:
		Materials, structure, strength
	Computer vision:
		Filtering, speed, tracking, distance, robustness (can we get a number for that?)
	gripper motion?
	Force needed to store
	catching?
		All of the above?


solutions:
	clamps
	steppers
	gearboxes
	ps3 cam
	laptop vs micro
	servos

soluton
	prototype steppers/arduino?
problems:
	Speed, torque (mainly torque), open loop (not an issue if enough torque)
test/redev:
	servos
	laptop


Implementation
	Frame
	kinematics
	camera/opencv
	gripper(s)
	clamps
