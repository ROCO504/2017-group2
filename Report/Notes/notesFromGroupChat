General structure looks good ðŸ™‚ In terms of pictures I would be fairly sparing as we only have 8 pages, definately want a picture of the finished activepassive grippers and frame in there, side by side picture of the screen carture and video and simulation... We want some cad stuff and fea in there aswell but that could possibly go in the appendices

Pictures:
finished both grippers (cad?)
Frame?
screencap vid/sim
FEA
control diagrams:
overall
kinematic controller
hough tracker
throw?

In terms of why we built the thing
Interesting research problem




In terms of why we built the thing
Mainly because its an interesting research problem
I think thats the best we of saying because it looked like fun xD

Research we have a fair few papers we can point to

Requirements
active gripper
passive gripper
throwing mechanism
Frame

throwing:
throwing motor set up
clamps
computer vision

computer vision as a seperate requirement
and gripper motion
which could be, motor setup + kinematics
and catching i guess

i guess you could switch some of that to solutions
so maybe for requirements
just start with catching and throwing
Break catching down into motion, vision and gripping
maybe add compliant
compliance

then for throwing break that down into force storage and quick release, or something like that

Then in solutions you can talk about, clamps, steppers, gearbox etc ðŸ™‚
