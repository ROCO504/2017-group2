DONE - DEMI'S PICTURE DOESN'T CALCULATE WHERE BALL LANDS (AT 2.5M)
Example to show how fast the robot has to move if a ball were thrown from three meters away

data on tracking distance vs resolution (and expoure times)

DONE
Why does point gripper not work?

DONE (0.64M^2)
frame working area - 0.64 square meters (0.895 * 0.715)

Minimum gripper speed (closing/opening)

DONE
nice gearbox calcs

How long does the arduino node take to run?

DONE
Force storage: Stepper torque, dynamixel torque, force storage to throw distance

Speed service call duration

node run speeds

time taken for:
image to hough tracker
hough tracker in to out (average 0.017507503940077634 seconds over about five minutes, see hough_tracker_duration_values_numbers for data)

time to kinematic controller
