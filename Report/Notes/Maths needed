Example to show how fast the robot has to move if a ball were thrown from three meters away

data on tracking distance vs resolution (and expoure times)

Why does point gripper not work?

frame working area

Minimum gripper speed (closing/opening)

nice gearbox calcs

How long does the arduino node take to run?

Force storage: Stepper torque, dynamixel torque, force storage to throw distance

Speed service call duration

node run speeds

time taken for:
image to hough tracker
hough tracker in to out (average 0.017507503940077634 seconds over about five minutes, see hough_tracker_duration_values_numbers for data)

time to kinematic controller
kinematic controller in to out
motor response rate?
overall latency (leaving camera to motor movement)
throw sequence
