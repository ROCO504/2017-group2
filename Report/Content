Problem:
Initially the kinematic solution considered the gripper as a point, as can be seen in \ref{kinematic_solution_1}. This worked for preliminary testing, but soon proved to be a problem when the limited torque of the stepper motors required equal tension on all cords at all times. This led to the development of the following kinematic model, which considered the gripper as a square. 

Initial kinematic solution:
Initially it was thought that the commands to each motor could be generated by looking directly at the returned X and Y coordinates of the tracked objects. To move the gripper upwards, the top two motors should rotate clockwise and the bottom two anticlockwise. To move the gripper to the left, the two left motors should rotate clockwise and the right two anticlockwise. This led to the following kinematic solution:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
M1 = Y - X \\
M2 = Y + X\\
M3 = -Y -X\\
M4 = -Y + X\\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
For high torque motors, elastic cords and a closed loop between the tracked object and the gripper, this approximation would have been functional. However, it would not have been accurate and it would unnesicarrily load the motors. When using stepper motors with low-current drivers, this solution caused the steppers to skip if the gripper was directed more than a few centimeters from the centre of the working area. 
This led to reevaluation of the kinematic solution.
