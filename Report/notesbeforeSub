Required speed of motors calculator
	Based on throw velocity of 5m/s at a 45 degree angle
	Time of flight = 0.721048s
	Distance = 2.54929m
	Max height = 0.637323
Work space of catcher = 1.145m
Diameter of spool = 10cm = 0.1m
Circumference of spool = 31.4159cm = 0.314159m
Required travel speed from corner to corner based off example = 1.6357m/s
Rotations per second = 5.2rps = 312rpm

Based off a required speed of 5.2 rps, a 10.4x multiplier gear box is required

Maximum torque required to lift a mass of 0.5kg = 5kg.cm
This would mean a torque of 50.2kg.cm(492Ncm) at the input stage of the gearbox

stepper max torque sst58d320 = 9kg.cm, usable = 7kg.cm
